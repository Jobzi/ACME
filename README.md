## Hi, everyone... Welcome to ACME

For ACME developer. I used Javascript with a "standard" [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) linter. Thanks to the Linter it helps a lot to maintain a readable code following rules determined by javascript stander.
 In conjunction with [nodemon](https://eslint.org/) for a more fluid development.

## Overview of project

**Install** — For this proyect I used nodejs

```terminal
npm install
```

**develop** — In the 'scripts' administration (it is a hash object of script commands that are executed at various times in the life cycle of your package).  To run in development mode use the following command.

```terminal
npm run dev
```
